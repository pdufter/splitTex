# splitTex


Split and merge Latex Files using the include command. 

* Split * 
Given that you wrote all your tex-code in one document, you may want to use the 'include' command to structure your work. The split_tex.py script does it automatically for you by splitting into files based on the '\section' command.

* Merge *
When you have a structured tex-document where you used the 'include' command to structure your work it sometimes can be annoying (e.g. if you want to search and replace in the whole document, share your work). The merge_tex.py file automatically creates one tex-file with all the content in it. 

TODO
- add example
- make usable from command line
- add option to split on different hierarchy levels
